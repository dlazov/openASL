A guide for learning Advanced Squad Leader (ASL).

This repo is a collection of files related to learning how to play Advanced
Squad Leader, a tactical World War II boardgame. 

I started this project because I enjoy teaching ASL but have found the materials
available to be lacking in one way or another. The documents in this collection
are meant to be highly readable for beginners, but also useful refreshers for
more advanced players.

As the project grows, I hope people will improve the articles by submitting pull
requests or forking and starting their own guide.
